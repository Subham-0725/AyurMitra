# Ayurveda Management System - Setup Instructions

## üîë Requirements Implementation

This project implements a complete booking and doctor dashboard system with the following features:

### ‚úÖ Implemented Features

1. **Patient Profile Form** - Stores patient info in localStorage
2. **Appointment Booking** - Saves appointments with patient + doctor details
3. **Doctor Login with Clerk** - Username/password authentication
4. **Dynamic Doctor Dashboard** - Shows appointments filtered by doctorId
5. **Automatic Redirect** - Redirects to `/doctor/:doctorId` after login

## üìã Setup Instructions

### 1. Clerk Configuration

#### Create Doctor Accounts in Clerk Dashboard:

1. Go to your Clerk Dashboard
2. Navigate to Users section
3. Create accounts for doctors using emails from CSV:
   - `vaidya.gopal.menon@ayurveda.com` (Doctor ID: 1)
   - `vaidya.nisha.bhat@ayurveda.com` (Doctor ID: 2)
   - `vaidya.priya.nair@ayurveda.com` (Doctor ID: 3)
   - `vaidya.deepak.shukla@ayurveda.com` (Doctor ID: 4)
   - etc.

#### Set Public Metadata for Each Doctor:

1. Select a doctor user in Clerk Dashboard
2. Go to "Metadata" tab
3. Add to "Public metadata":
```json
{
  "doctorId": "2"
}
```

### 2. Testing the System

#### Option 1: Use Demo Data
1. Navigate to `/demo` in your browser
2. Click "Create Demo Data" 
3. This creates sample patient profile and appointments in localStorage

#### Option 2: Manual Testing
1. Go to `/patient-profile` and fill out patient information
2. Go to `/appointment-booking` and search symptoms
3. Select a doctor and click "Book Appointment"

### 3. Doctor Login Flow

1. Create doctor account in Clerk with email: `vaidya.nisha.bhat@ayurveda.com`
2. Set publicMetadata: `{"doctorId": "2"}`
3. Go to `/doctor-login`
4. Login with the doctor credentials
5. Should automatically redirect to `/doctor/2`
6. Dashboard shows appointments filtered for doctorId "2"

## üìä Data Structure

### Patient Profile (localStorage: 'patientProfile')
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": "35",
  "phone": "9876543210", 
  "address": "123 Main Street, Delhi",
  "gender": "male",
  "bloodGroup": "O+",
  "emergencyContact": "9876543211",
  "medicalHistory": "No major medical history"
}
```

### Appointments (localStorage: 'appointments')
```json
[
  {
    "doctorId": "2",
    "doctorName": "Vaidya Nisha Bhat",
    "patientName": "John Doe", 
    "age": "35",
    "phone": "9876543210",
    "address": "123 Main Street, Delhi",
    "symptoms": "migraine, stuffy nose",
    "appointmentDate": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
    "status": "pending"
  }
]
```

## üîÑ Complete User Flow

### Patient Booking Flow:
1. Patient fills profile form ‚Üí stored in localStorage
2. Patient searches symptoms ‚Üí finds matching doctors from CSV
3. Patient clicks "Book Appointment" ‚Üí appointment saved to localStorage
4. Appointment includes: patient info + symptoms + doctorId + doctorName

### Doctor Dashboard Flow:
1. Doctor logs in via Clerk ‚Üí gets doctorId from publicMetadata
2. Redirects to `/doctor/:doctorId` 
3. Dashboard loads appointments from localStorage
4. Filters appointments by doctorId
5. Doctor can update appointment status (pending/confirmed/completed/cancelled)

## üõ† Key Files Modified

- `AppointmentBooking.jsx` - Added appointment saving to localStorage
- `DoctorLogin.jsx` - Added Clerk authentication with redirect
- `DoctorDashboard.jsx` - Made dynamic with doctorId filtering
- `App.jsx` - Added dynamic route `/doctor/:doctorId`

## üöÄ Next Steps (Future API Integration)

When ready to replace localStorage with backend APIs:

1. Replace `localStorage.getItem('appointments')` with API calls
2. Replace `localStorage.setItem('appointments')` with POST/PUT requests
3. Add authentication middleware to protect doctor routes
4. Implement real-time updates with WebSockets

## üìù Notes

- All data is currently stored in localStorage (frontend-only)
- Doctor information is loaded from the CSV file
- Clerk handles authentication and user management
- The system is fully functional for testing and demo purposes
- Ready for backend integration when needed
